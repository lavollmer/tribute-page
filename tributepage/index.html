          Grace Murray Hopper (1906-1992) was a pioneering computer scientist
          and naval officer who made significant contributions to the field of
          computer programming. Here are some key details about her life and
          achievements:
        </p>
        <p>Early Life and Education:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Grace Hopper was born on December 9, 1906, in New York City, USA.
          </li>
          <li>
            She earned her bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from
            Vassar College in 1928.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hopper then went on to complete her master's degree and Ph.D. in
            mathematics at Yale University in 1930 and 1934, respectively.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Contributions to Computer Science:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Hopper played a crucial role in the development of the COBOL (Common
            Business-Oriented Language) programming language, which became
            widely used for business applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            She advocated for the idea of writing programs in a language closer
            to English rather than machine code, making programming more
            accessible to non-technical users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hopper's contributions to computer programming and software
            development methodologies had a lasting impact on the field.
          </li>
